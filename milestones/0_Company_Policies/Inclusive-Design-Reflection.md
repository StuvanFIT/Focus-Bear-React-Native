### Who are considered vulnerable populations, and what challenges might they face in digital spaces?
- Neurodivergent people, people with disabilities, elderly users, low digital literacy, non-native speakers.

This can result in challenges such as overstimulating designs, unclear instructions, inaccessible layouts, lack of flexibility, exclusion from communication

### What ethical considerations are important when designing or working with neurodivergent individuals? (Hint: Avoid overwhelming UX, respect sensory needs, ensure clear communication.)

Neurodivergent individuals like those with ADHD, autism or sensory processing differences can often find overwhelming or noisy UX difficult due to :
- Sensory overload, where there are too many colours, sounds and pop-ups or moving elements can trigger stress or nausea or anxiety.
- Cognitive load: clutter forces the brain to filter out distractions, which is harder for people with attention differences.

TLDR: Overwhelming UX makes it chaotic and causes friction instead of flow for neurodivergent users.

### How can you make interactions and content more accessible for people with ADHD or Autism? (e.g., simple language, predictable navigation, reducing cognitive load)

- Simple and relatively understandable language -->dont user overcomplicated words
- Make sure the overall NAVIGATION CONTROL is intuitive and predictable.
- Reduce chunked paragraphs that contain a lot of text

### How can we support neurodivergent team members in a professional setting? (Hint: Be clear in communication, respect different working styles, and allow flexibility.)

Since there is a larger variety and preferences, we need to allow for more flexibility in how tasks are completed.


### How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?
- There are people with different communication style preferences. Thus, to accomodate or support various processing styles, we should offer multiple formats. This includes written summary notes, visuals, diagrams or verbal explanations via short videos.

- I will try keep my responses and communication in a relatively structured format. For example, I will use headings, bullet points, numbered steps and use code segments when necessary. 

- I will make sure to check if my peers understood my responses in a gentle manner  (i.e. Does this make sense? What parts of it didnt you understand?)


### What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?

- Too much or unncessary sounds or noise
- Overly complex UI and busy interfaces. For example, like too many options, cluttered dashboards and distracting animations
- No ability to allow customisation or preferences. Not allowing customisation might make users feel restricted in their experience. For example, light/dark mode or the motivational quotes like cheerleader

### What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?

I want to make sure I understand the target vulnerable audience. Before I start designing a feature, I want to make sure I take into account how the vulnerable client would feel when using the application. For example, I would allow users to customise their notifications such as the overall tone (i.e. supportive  vs firm), frequency or format (text or sound/vibration)

In this example, it makes sure that the design decision has incorporated the atarget audience and direclty support neurodivergent users (who may struggle with overstimulation), people with anxiety (who may find pushy reminders stressful), and anyone with unique focus needs.
