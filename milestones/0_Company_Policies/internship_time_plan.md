# Steven's Timetable

## Context

As a software engineering student at Monash University, I have a hectic schedule balancing academic commitments with other responsibilities including part-time work and passion projects. To ensure successful participation in the Focus Bear internship while maintaining my existing commitments, I have developed this comprehensive time management plan.

This detailed timetable addresses:

- Specific working days and time slots
- Exact duration of work sessions
- Designated work locations
- Weekly hour allocation

Note that the following may change a bit but it is always good to have a plan before hand to keep myself on track!

## Weekly Time Table Plan

|-----|-----------|----------|----------|-------|-------|
| **Monday** | 09:00 AM - 13:00 PM or 22:00 PM - 02:00 AM | 4 hours | Remote (Home Office, Melbourne VIC) | 4.0 | |

**Total Weekly Hours:** 10 - 16 hours

## Work Environment Setup

- Potential for increased hours during the break
