### What is a “User Manual for Me”, and why do teams use them?

A user manual is basically a short guide that explains to other co-workers on how you personally work efficiently or the best. This manual would include your communication style (i.e. discord, teams, slack), preferences, strengths, weaknesses and quirks. Teams can use your user-manual to:

* Gain a brief understanding of how you work in team environments.
* Build self-awareness and help others understand you.
* Reduce misunderstandings and friction in collaboration.
* Setting clear team expectations when working together.

### What categories are helpful to include? (e.g., communication style, work habits, feedback preferences)

In the user-manual, it is helpful to include the following:
* Communication style
* Working habits
* Collaboration and team work
* Focus and productivity
* Feedback preferences
* Fun facts/quirks about yourself

### How can writing a personal user manual improve teamwork and reduce misunderstandings?

This personal user manual would improve teamwork and reduce overall misunderstandings as it makes it easier for your teammateso adapt their communication to each person. Prevents avoidable conflicts caused by different work styles. For example, if a person A preferred to be given positive feedback, then person B would adjust their feedback to be more supportive but still constructive. Additionally, it helps with reducing the amount of time needed to "guess" how someone works best.

### What do you need from teammates to do your best work? (e.g., direct communication, flexibility, detailed instructions, minimal interruptions)

1. Clear communication and response times. If I send a message in the teams chat, I should expect relatively fast responses to address any issues early on. Also, messages or instructions sent should be clear for everyone to ensure everyone knows what they are doing.
2. Be postive and have fun. I believe that a successfull team environment is built upon having a positive working environment. If I am in an environment where people are constantly reinforcing my skills and confidence, then I'm most likely going to do well. However, I would also love constructive criticism and "tough-love" in order to push myself.
3. Be flexible and willing to adapt. If someone presents an idea that is outside your comfort zone but ensures the betterment of the team, then you should be willing to adjust and be flexible.

### How do you prefer to communicate? (e.g., async messages, video calls, quick check-ins, long discussions)

I prefer to communicate via team video calls, daily/weekly check ins and also long but productive discussions.
The specific communication method I prefer are mostly online such as discord messages, zoom or slack.

So basically:
Quick async messages (Slack/Teams) or daily/weekly standups for small updates.
Occasional video calls for complex discussions.
If a video call is not possible, then written documentation for longer verbal explanations.

### What helps you stay focused and productive? (e.g., quiet workspace, deep work sessions, structured to-do lists, music)

1. A quiet workspace
2. Deep working sessions with minimal or low context-switching
3. Sometimes music but just depends (i.e any calm relaxing sounds). But, Headphones stay on!
4. Have other teammates giving me feedback constantly to ensure I am up to date

### How do you like to give and receive feedback? (e.g., clear & direct, with positive reinforcement, written vs. verbal feedback)

I need to have constructive feedback. I would love teammates to clearly criticise my work to ensure I can enhance my skills as a software engineer. At the end of the day, as long as I learn something new, its better than having a "false" perception of my skills. However, any positive reinforcement would be appreciated as it makes my day!

In terms of the method of feedback: prefer if it was in video so we can go back and forth on feedback and have discussions on how to improve my work. I do not mind written feedback as well.

So basically: A mix of both constructive, harsh feedback and positive reinforcement helps and over a video session or written text.

### What are some quirks or things to know about your work style? (e.g., need time to process ideas, like to brainstorm out loud, prefer written instructions)

Whenever there are new features or a new code base I have to work on, it takes time for me to fully feel comfortable working on it and understand the ins and outs of the project. Thus, I need to spend some time processes new information before I can make any changes/modifications or give a final opinion.

I prefer written instructions to ensure I have a structured workflow and know what I am doing next. Although I value structure, I also enjoy flexibility for creative problem-solving. If an idea is being presented, I would like a visual representation of the idea---> even a rough sketch/diagram would do as my brain works better by learning visually!
