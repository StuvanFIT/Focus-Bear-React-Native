Cyber security breaches can lead to data leaks, financial loss, and reputational damage. Everyone at Focus Bear plays a role in keeping information safe by following good security habits.


### What are common cyber security threats in a remote work environment?

- Poor or weak password practices from employees.This is bad practice and increases the likelihood of unauthorised access. So if an outside threat were to initiate an attack, it would leverage weak authentication as a way to bypass into the company's system.

- Cloud Storage Vupnerabilities. A lot of remote developers will collaborate on files online. However, if the cloud storage platforms are not configured correctly, they can become a potential vulnerability. For example, this would include poorly configured access/authorisation controls or insecure links

- Exploiting Collaboration tools such as Zoom, microsoft teams and slack. There are multiple instances of pranksters or unauthorised users getting access to zoom links or exploiting weak security settings.

- Phising Attacks. Attackers will constantly send out fradulent emails or impersonate trusted entities such as banks or companies to trick individuals into entering or revealing sensitive data (like your password, emails or bank details). You see these everywhere through emails, messages, or deceptive websites that prompt users to click on links.


### What are best practices for keeping your devices and accounts secure?

- Please do not use a weak or the same password for every different account. Create a password that is strong, unique and something that cant be easily guessed. Additionally, you could implement password managers and policies that enforce high password strength. 

- If the feature is available, always enable 2 factor authentication.

- Back up important data regularly

- Make sure to regularly update your softwares, systems and apps to prevent attackers from exploiting old versions. There are some cases of attackers exploting old versions of systems i.e. hidden backdooring attack.


### Why is it important to lock your computer when away from your desk?

- It prevents any unauthorised access from accessing your sensitive data, files or company tools.
- Prevents accidental data leakage.
- If the account is an admin, locking your PC can prevent the misusage or deliberate tampering of data.


### How should you handle phishing attempts and suspicious links?

- If you receive an unexpected link or attachment, do not immediately click on it. First, verify the sender and check if the email is verified/real first. Look for red flags such as incorrect/misspelled domains or unusual requests. After verification, report the email to prevent/block the contact.


### What makes a strong password, and why should you use a password manager?

A strong password would consist of the following:
- Minimum of 8 characters long
- Use of special characters
- Numbers
- Uppercase and lowercase letters
- Not easily guessable like your name, birthday or ag

Note that each unique account should have a unique password to prevent or stop the spread of exploited password vulnerabilities.

Remote workers would use password managers to securely store and autofill your credentials so you don’t have to memorise dozens of your passwords. These passwords they create are very strong as well.


### Why is two-factor authentication (2FA) important, and when should you enable it?

- Two-Factor authentication adds another deep layer of security beyond your password and usually a code sent by SMS message or an authentication app is used for verification. Even if a password is stolen, attackers still need the second factor to get in.

- Users should enable 2FA in every situation at minimum. This includes enabling it on emails, cloud storages and bank accounts. Although it is described as "tedious", it is incredibly essential in ensuring your sensitive data is secured.




### What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?

-I currently attempt tp create unique passwords for every unique account I create. Additionally, if I know that I will access an application exclusively on my desktop, I will use password manager to create a strong password for me. However, I will admit that I have created multiple weak passwords or used the same password for many different accounts and is still an area where I can improve in.

- Enabling 2FA for critical and essential accounts

Security measures I can improve on:
- Make sure to close my laptop/PC whenever I have completed my tasks.


### How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?
Usually, to build habits I try to fit in a routinely manner and try to use automation in a way increase efficiency. For example:
- I will persistently lock my laptop/PC or close any sensitive browsers when I have completed my tasks or I no longer need them for the rest of the day.
- Always enabling auto-lock, password managers, and software updates so security happens without constant effort.
- Be vigilant and mindful. Before immediately clicking on links, check if its a safe space.

Usually, if I make an analogy or use juxtaposition, it gets stored in my head longer. For example, 
if I treat software security as my "health", then it would motivate me to commit to improving my security practices.


### What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?
- Use strong, unique passwords (8+ characters with special characters, numbers, and letters).
- User password manager to create strong passwords
- Enable 2FA in every possible scenario
- Regularly review active logins/devices and remove any I don’t recognise.
- Not reusing work passwords for personal accounts.


### What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?
When I feel like my data is unsafe or has been breached, I would execute the following:
- Changing my password for the account immediately, whilst following the password standard guidelines
- If the company has a security/IT department, I would contact them about any suspicious activity
- Make sure 2FA is enabled
- Constantly check up on any data modifications or changes made by potential attackers (i.e reset password emails, sending emails, sending malicious links) and report them to my manager/director.


### My New Cyber Secutiy Habit:
“I will lock my computer every single time I step away from my desk, even for a short break, to prevent unauthorised access”
