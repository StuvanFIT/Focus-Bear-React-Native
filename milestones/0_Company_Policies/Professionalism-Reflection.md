### Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?
I've been apart of good and bad teams and experienced the highs and lows during project team learning. Some key aspects I've seen that make a good team are the following:

- Positive team environment. It makes coming to daily standup meetings more enjoyable and I feel more motivated to spend my time having productive discussions whilst building new relationships with others. Cracking a joke or sharing experiences can seriously uplift the team environment and small talk like these help contribute to a positive team environment. Also, a successful team should have a supportive culture and having members help each other when in need and covering certain weaknesses members might have, instead of competing against each other.

- Clear division of roles and task assignment. There are some project experiences where one member takes upon the burden and a majority of the workload, resulting in task imbalance amongst members. However, having experienced this, this is a unsustainable approach and leads to the individual feeling burnt out near the end of the sprint/project. However, project teams that have equal task assignment (or equal weightage) are more likely to succeed as not just one member is doing everything. Additionally, having an assigned role increases the likelihood of the team succeeding as everyone knows what they are doing and meant to do over the sprint.

-A shared goal. A commonn goal everyone has to keep the entire team aligned.

-Open and respectful communication and feedback where everyones input is heard from and valued.


### What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?
This is actually a skill I would like to improve on. During this internship, I will improve my communication by:
- Actively listening and process my understanding before responding to others
- Always be mindful of my tone and verbal messages to not come across in rude manner
- Include everyone in discussions and donâ€™t talk over people.
- Adapt communication style for different personalities

### How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?
- Talk about how my day went
- If I hear something that I can relate to, I'll try to add to the discussion!
- Always show up on time
- Always be approachable and be willing to help others around me
- Be funny and humourous 
- Be kind to others 

### How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?
- I will review the meeting agenda and meeting goals beforehand
- Try to keep the agenda clear
- Be on time
- Keep my contributions concise and relevant to prevent time wasting on topics we've already discussed or are unnecessary

### What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?
- Before asking for help, I will take intiative to complete the task by myself
- Offer to assist teammates when I have the capacity to.
- Get feedback regularly every time I work on a feature

### How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?
I usually commit to the following procedure:
1. Politely follow up via the same channel after a reasonable time (1-2 days)
2. Try an alternative communication tool
3. If still no response and the task is blocking, escalate respectfully to my supervisor/manager, explaining the urgency.

Note: I will only escalate after multiple attempts and when it affects deadlines or project progress.

### What are some things you won't do?
- Ignore deadlines
- Leaving assigned tasks unfinished or untouched
- Disrespect teammates
- Share confidential company information as I am in a working business
