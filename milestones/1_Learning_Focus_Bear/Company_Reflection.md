# Company Reflection – Focus Bear  

## Understanding Focus Bear’s Mission & Vision  

AI DECLARATION: Aritificial Intelligence was not used at all during this reflection. It is just a genuine file of my thoughts!

### Why do you think Focus Bear was created?  
Focus Bear was created with the intention of helping people with ADHD stay focused on their tasks, boost their productivity, and keeping themselves on track. I believe the app came from a very real and personal place, Jeremy (the founder) had a problem, and he wanted to fix it for himself. Once he found a solution that worked, he saw the opportunity to share it with others facing the same struggles. That’s really what Software Engineering is about, identifying a problem and building something meaningful that can make life better for people.  

### What problem is Focus Bear solving?  
Focus Bear is solving the problem of staying productive and on task when your brain and mind is working against you. ADHD can make even simple things feel overwhelming or stressful for people and Focus Bear provides the tools and structure that help reduce distractions and make it easier for people to actually follow through on the things they want to do.  

### Why do you think this mission is important?  
I’ve seen firsthand how important this mission is. While working in the pharmacy retail industry (Chemist Warehouse), I noticed just how many patients in my local community rely on ADHD and mental health medications. From speaking with my pharmacy manager, roughly 30–40% of the prescriptions we filled were related to ADHD, which made me realize how common this condition really is in Australia.  

I’ll never forget a conversation with one of our regular customers. She described her ADHD as “severely dysfunctional”  explaining how she knew exactly what she wanted to do each day, and desperately wanted to do it, but it felt like she was in a paralysed state. She would spent hours doing nothing and jut get nothing done. That conversation opened my eyes to how impactful ADHD can truly be to a person's dailyhood, and why solutions like Focus Bear matter so much.  

### How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?
During my degree, I feel like I've lost my sense of direction and what I wanted to achieve in life. In my engineering degree, I mainly focused on achieving the best grades possible and not truly learning anything useful in my career. At some point, I sort of just stopped and kinda observed the direction I was heading towards and honestly, I wasnt really proud of what I was doing. So I decided to dig deep into my thoughts and sort of understand why I wanted to do Software Engineering. I think thats where I found that I actually like helping people and finding a solution for them. I’ve always been passionate about using technology and coding to create projects that make a real, positive impact on people’s lives. I wanted to actively contribute to a project that specifically helps others who dont have the necessary resources. I think thats what software engineering/technology should be used for, helping clients/businesses/communities improve their overall life style.

Honestly, if what I've written above makes sense, Focus Near fulfils my wish list and checks off what I want to do! Focus Bear is exactly the kind of project I’d love to be part of, something that’s not just functional, but meaningful. Knowing that the work can directly improve someone’s quality of life makes the mission even more inspiring.  

### Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?  
While I am not diagnosed with ADHD, I can relate to the challenge of losing focus and struggling to stay on task. There are times when I know exactly what needs to be done, but distractions or lack of structure get in the way. I see Focus Bear as a tool that doesn’t just serve people with ADHD, but can also benefit anyone who wants to be more intentional and productive with their time.
