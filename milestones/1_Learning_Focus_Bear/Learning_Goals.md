### What do I hope to learn from this internship?

I've worked on many project with many different sizes during the course of my degree, however, I hope to learn what it takes to fit and work in a real professional environment with other amazing developers and coworkers. I want to know how certain lifecycles are structured (i.e agile development, scrum) or what coding practices used (i.e. specific software quality requirements).

### What skills are you most excited to develop?

I've struggled with my ability to frequently get out of my comfort zone and try something new for once. I think this is a great opportunity for me to slot in an environment where I need to learn how to efficiently communicate with others, specifically working on my emotional intelligence and emphasise the importance of knowing how to build relationships effectively in a timely manner.

### What do you think you can contribute to the team?

I truly believe that I can bring in a strong work ethic to the team and brining in new ideas to the development agile team. I want to be able to connect with everyone and learn how to incorporate the work/abilities of all developers of different skill levels as well. More importantly, I think that I could contribute to a positive team environment that could elevate overall team productivity!

### What is one area you feel less confident in that youâ€™d like to improve?

Definitely explaining my views and ideas to others. I feel like I could implement my ideas myself, however, from recent project team experiences, a reoccurring feedback was that I could not explain my ideas to others, in a way that everyone can understand.

At first I didnt really think much about as I just cared about the work being completed. However, If you're going to be in a team environment, you should be able to express your ideas to anyone, no matter the skill level.

This could include specific sections of code/files I am implementing, messages in the discord chat or task assignment.

### What does success in this internship look like for you?

Success to me in this internship looks like this:

- Consistently work on my and complete them by due dates. I think that any tasks left uncompleted by would make me feel very upset and disappointed in myself!
- At least learning a new practice/skill I can apply to my own personal/uni projects. This can include specific git workflows you guys use, file structures or project lifecycle structures.
- Building positive relationships with others in Focus Bear. Hopefully, I don't finish my internship on a bad note and Jeremy hates me!
- Seeing my contributions live on the server! Probably one of the most satisfying feelings as a software engineer.
