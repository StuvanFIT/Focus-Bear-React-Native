## Why is automated testing important in software development?

Automated testing is a lifesaver and can be crucial in identifying bugs during the early stages of development. This prevents projects from having deeply integrated bugs that may pop up in the future and would cause large refactoring sessions.

Automated tests execute significantly faster than manual tests, allowing for more frequent testing cycles and quicker feedback on code changes. This is why CI/CD pipelines are essential

As applications get bigger, having a suite of these tests is going to be important for regression testing.

## What did you find challenging when writing your first Jest test?

Nothing challenging when setting up Jest Tests. Other than having to identify all possible edge cases of your testing. Poor identificatio of test cases can lead to small bugs that get missed through testing and end up in the final product.
