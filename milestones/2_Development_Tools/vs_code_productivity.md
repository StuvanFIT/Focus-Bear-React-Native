### Which shortcuts will be the most useful in your daily work?

The multiple cursor shortcuts (Alt + Click, Ctrl + D & Ctrl + Shift + L) will be the most useful because they allow me to edit many parts of the code at once without repeating the same actions. This is a huge game changer when wanting to perform refactoring or updating repetitive code.

### How can keyboard shortcuts improve productivity?

Keyboard shortcuts reduce the need to constantly switch between the mouse and keyboard. This speeds up navigation, editing, and debugging by keeping me in the flow of coding. Over time, the small time savings add up, which overall contribute to higher producutivity.
