# My top 10 VSCODE Shortcuts for VSCODE Productivity

### Navigation

- `Ctrl + Shift +` ` = This is the most common command I've used as it quickly opens up a new terminal
- `Ctrl +` ` = Opens up the terminal window
- `Ctrl + F` = Find
- `Ctrl + Shift + T` = reopens last opened tab

### Editing

- `Ctrl + Enter` = enter new line
- `Alt + Click` =  Allows you to perform multiple clicks/highlights
- `Ctrl + D` =  Select the next occurrence of the clicked word
- `Ctrl + Shift + L` = Select all occurrences of the word
- `Alt + UP/DOWN ARROW` = move the current line you are on up or down without copy-paste. GAME CHANGING SHORTCUT

### Debugging

- `Ctrl + Shift + F9` = Delete All Breakpoints. Removes all breakpoints set in the current workspace.

### Which shortcuts will be the most useful in your daily work?

The multiple cursor shortcuts (Alt + Click, Ctrl + D & Ctrl + Shift + L) will be the most useful because they allow me to edit many parts of the code at once without repeating the same actions. This is a huge game changer when wanting to perform refactoring or updating repetitive code.

### How can keyboard shortcuts improve productivity?

Keyboard shortcuts reduce the need to constantly switch between the mouse and keyboard. This speeds up navigation, editing, and debugging by keeping me in the flow of coding. Over time, the small time savings add up, which overall contribute to higher producutivity.

### LINK TO PULL REQUEST

[Link to pull request](https://github.com/StuvanFIT/Focus-Bear-React-Native/pull/67)

In this pull request, I documented my top VS Code shortcuts that improved my coding efficiency and workflow. Writing this helped me identify which commands I naturally rely on (like multiple cursors and terminal shortcuts) and which new ones I can start using more consistently to save time during development.

For example, in my recent project coding session, everytime i wanted to open up the terminal again, instead of clicking Terminal -> New Terminal, I would instead do CTRL +SHIFT + ` which makes my workflow feel more smooth and quicker.
