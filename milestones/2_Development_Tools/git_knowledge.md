### Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?

I have used GIT in many occasions during uni and personal projects. I typically use GIT to manage git branches, commits my changes, merge and collaborate with other developers on our team github repository.

### Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?

I mainly use GIT in VSCODE as it is intuitive and easier to use in my workflow and development. Most of my development occurs in VSCODE. However, from time to time, I use GITHUB DESKTOP but very rarely.

### What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?

Recently came across a new git command:

git rerere: Stands for "reuse recorded resolution"

<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49500943/what-is-git-rerere-and-how-does-it-work>

- this feature helps Git remember how you resolved a conflict and automatically reapply that resolution if the same conflict arises again in the future.TLDR: AUTOMATICALLY HANDLES MERGES
