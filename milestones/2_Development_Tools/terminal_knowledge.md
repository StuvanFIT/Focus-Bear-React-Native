### Which terminal client did you choose? Why?

Windows Terminal + Powershell

- Throughout my journey, I have mostly worked on a Windows Environment and am somewhat experienced with the overall navigation and common commands used.

### What customisations (if any) did you make?

- None

### What was the most useful command you learned today?

- The most useful command that I have used is `kill -9 PID`

There are many times I've had running ports in the background that prevented me from running on localhost:3000.

Another one is echo helloworld...
