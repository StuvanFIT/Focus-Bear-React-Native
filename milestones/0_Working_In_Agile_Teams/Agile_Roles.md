### What are the key roles in an Agile team, and what does each role do?
Developers: This role mainly focuses on building, prototyping and delivering features, fixing bug/defects and ensure the application is working in production. 

QA (Quality Assurance): This role focuses on software quality testing. Testing new features, prevent defects, and ensure reliability before release.

Product Manager (PM): Owns the product vision and project goal, prioritises backlog (can reprioritise after sprint meetings), and aligns features with user needs/feedback. Reponsible for communicating back n forth with the client

Agile Project Manager (Agile PM): Facilitates process, removes blockers, and ensures smooth Agile flow.

UX Designers: They ensure high usability and accessibility of features.

Customer Support: Underrated role. They bring user feedback and pain points into the process.


### How do these roles collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?
PMs will talk to the client and create and prioritise the backlog with a bunch of user stories. These user stories would have a tag or specific subtasks if necessary. An owner is assigned to them. Then, the developers would have a look at the user stories, break them down into smaller tasks and develop them. The scrum master/agile manager will faciliate meetings and make sure everything runs smoothly. The QA team will test the developers code and ensure good quality of code was written and testing went smoothly.


###  What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?
My role is the Mobile Application Developer.

I will design, build, and ship features that align with the PMâ€™s priorities, collaborating with QA to ensure high quality. I also give input on feasibility and technical trade-offs.

### How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?
I work closely with QA as they test what I build, and I support them by writing testable, clean code.
Additionally, I will frequently communicate with PMs as they structure the backlog and ensure what tasks need to be prioritised. In most cases, I will need to collaborate with UX designers to ensure I implement designs that are suitable for users.

### Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.
As a Mobile Application Developer, I contribute to the Agile team by building features, fixing bugs, and collaborating with PM, QA, and UX to deliver user-focused, high-quality software. My role ensures that ideas become working solutions in production code.

### Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.
I want to communicate with the QA team more frequently as I believe that software quality testing is important. This involves sharing context early (edge cases, assumptions, test data) and involve QA in discussions before implementation to reduce back-and-forth later.
