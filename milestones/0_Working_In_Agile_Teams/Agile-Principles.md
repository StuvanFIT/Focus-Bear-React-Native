### What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?

Agile is a type of framework in project management that mainly prioritises flexibility, client feedback and collaboration. This allows teams to adapt to change and deliver value incrementally through short development cycles called "sprints".
So essentially, it is an iterative, flexible approach focused on continuous delivery and client feedback.

On the otherhand, a traditional project management framework like the Waterfall approach, is a linear and very rigid framework that consist of very long phases (i.e. Requirements ---> Design ---> Development --> Testing ---> Release).
Its what most project teams have used in the past, however, the agile development process has been adopted more recently.

TLDR: the key difference is that Agile allows teams to adapt to changes quickly whilst a more traditional project management framework like Waterfall, does not offer the same flexibility and is rigid.

### What are the core values and principles of Agile? (Hint: Check the Agile Manifesto.)

The four key values are:

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and too as it reminds me that open communication and collaboration matter more than using the “perfect” tool.  
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation. It means the idea that emphasises building something that actually works, not just planning endlessly.  
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation, highlights that understanding user needs is more valuable than rigid agreements.  
4. Responding to change over following a plan – reinforces the importance of flexibility, especially in startup companies liek focus bear where priorities shift often.  

### What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?

Scrum

- The work is divided into fixed-length sprints (e.g., commonly its 2 weeks in my uni projects).
- Product Owner, Scrum Master, Release train engineers, solution architects and development team.
- Commit to sprint goals, deliver incrementally.

Kanban

- Continuous flow of tasks, no time-boxed sprints.
- Visual board tracks work-in-progress
- Optimise flow, thus it reduces bottlenecks.

So Kanban is better for teams that need flexibility, variable priorities, and continuous delivery
and Scrum is better for teams needing structure and incremental delivery

### Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?

- Since Focus Bear is a startup, priorities might shift a little bit and maybe volatile?
- Kanban allows more flexibility than Scrum’s rigid sprints.
- Simpler process and its easier to keep track of tasks as you visualise the entire workflow

### What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?

- Benefits = faster delivery, flexibility, better customer alignment, continuous improvement.
- Challenges = requires discipline from team members, and can feel chaotic without structure, depends on strong communication from the team

### How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?

- It helps me embrace feedback feedback from the client/developers quickly
- I can break bgi tasks into smaller sub tasks or chunks for more consistent progress
- Allows me to effectively communicate any potential blockers to keep the project flow running

### Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work

"Responding to change over following a plan"

As I am an intern at Focus Bear, my priorities can change very quickly and are volatile and I have to be flexible and adaptable in these kind of environments in order to help me stay on track or stay valuable to the team

### Personal experience Using Agile

In one of my university software engineering projects (FIT3170 – Software Engineering Practice), our team of  used the Scrum framework. I was the Scrum Master (release train engineer), responsible for running stand-ups, tracking progress, and ensuring we met our sprint goals. During one sprint, our tutor’s feedback required us to completely redesign a feature mid-development. Initially, it felt frustrating to pivot, but through short iterations and daily check-ins, we quickly reprioritised tasks and adapted the backlog. This was communicated with our product managers at the time and they updated for the team to let everyone know of the changes

This experience showed me the real strength of Agile an wiresponding to change and collaborating closely with others. It taught me that flexibility and open communication are far more valuable than rigidly following a plan.
