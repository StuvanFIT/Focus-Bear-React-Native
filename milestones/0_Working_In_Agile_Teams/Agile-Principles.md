### What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?

Agile is a type of framework in project management that mainly prioritises flexibility, client feedback and collaboration. This allows teams to adapt to change and deliver value incrementally through short development cycles called "sprints".
So essentially, it is an iterative, flexible approach focused on continuous delivery and client feedback.

On the otherhand, a traditional project management framework like the Waterfall approach, is a linear and very rigid framework that consist of very long phases (i.e. Requirements ---> Design ---> Development --> Testing ---> Release).
Its what most project teams have used in the past, however, the agile development process has been adopted more recently.

TLDR: the key difference is that Agile allows teams to adapt to changes quickly whilst a more traditional project management framework like Waterfall, does not offer the same flexibility and is rigid.

### What are the core values and principles of Agile? (Hint: Check the Agile Manifesto.)

### What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?

Scrum

- The work is divided into fixed-length sprints (e.g., commonly its 2 weeks in my uni projects).
- Product Owner, Scrum Master, Release train engineers, solution architects and development team.
- Commit to sprint goals, deliver incrementally.

Kanban

- Continuous flow of tasks, no time-boxed sprints.
- Visual board tracks work-in-progress
- Optimise flow, thus it reduces bottlenecks.

So Kanban is better for teams that need flexibility, variable priorities, and continuous delivery
and Scrum is better for teams needing structure and incremental delivery

### Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?

- Since Focus Bear is a startup, priorities might shift a little bit and maybe volatile?
- Kanban allows more flexibility than Scrumâ€™s rigid sprints.
- Simpler process and its easier to keep track of tasks as you visualise the entire workflow

### What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?

- Benefits = faster delivery, flexibility, better customer alignment, continuous improvement.
- Challenges = requires discipline from team members, and can feel chaotic without structure, depends on strong communication from the team

### How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?

- It helps me embrace feedback feedback from the client/developers quickly
- I can break bgi tasks into smaller sub tasks or chunks for more consistent progress
- Allows me to effectively communicate any potential blockers to keep the project flow running

### Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work

"Responding to change over following a plan"

As I am an intern at Focus Bear, my priorities can change very quickly and are volatile and I have to be flexible and adaptable in these kind of environments in order to help me stay on track or stay valuable to the team
