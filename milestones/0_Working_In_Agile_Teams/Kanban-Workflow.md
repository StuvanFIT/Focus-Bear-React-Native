### How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?

![alt text](/milestones/Images/kanban.png)

A Kanban board is a visual tool that shows the flow of work from idea to completion. It helps teams (and individuals) see the status of each task at a glance, identify bottlenecks, and balance workload.

By breaking big goals into smaller tasks and moving them across columns, everyone can see progress in real time and adjust if something gets stuck.

### What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent? (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done)

- Backlog/ToDo ==> Tasks that are ready but not yet started.
- In Progress ==> Work currently being done by developers
- Blocked ==> Tasks that can’t move forward due to dependencies or blockers, waiting for feedback, or external issues.
- Review/Testing ==> Work that needs QA, code review, or validation.
- Done/Completed tasks ==> ready for release or already delivered.

### How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?

- Tasks move from left to right across the board.
- Note that the person working on that task, should be the owner of the task and is reponsible for updating/fixing any blockers/defects or issues that may come up.
- Only the owner of the task should be able to move the card. In some teams, the Agile PM or Scrum Master helps nudge updates during stand-ups, but ownership lies with the individual working on the task.

### What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?

Limiting work in progress (WIP) means setting a maximum number of tasks that can be in a certain stage of a workflow simultaneously to promote finishing work before starting new work.

Benefits:

- Less context switching
- Early signs of problem detection. If one column fills up, its a sign of bottlenecks.

### How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?

- The backlog is ordered by priority, so the most important tasks are picked up first by developers. So, we get rid of the critical tasks first and complete the low priority tasks later.

- WIP limits helps keep the team from overcommitting.

- Visualisation makes it obvious when someone has too much on their plate as the columns show workload distribution. This helps maintain a sustainable pace without burning out the entire team.

### How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?

- Implementing WIP limits. I actually find this aspect important as I can apply this to my outside work. Don’t start a new task until you’ve finished or handed off the current one. It keeps me controlled and paced throughout my work.

### Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role

During my past project teams where we've used kanban boards, Ive struggled to consistently update the board at the end of each feauture completion. Sometimes tasks live in my head instead of the board, which makes it harder for teammates to see my progress. By making sure everything is logged and updated, I can improve overall team transparency and make collaboration smoother.
