### Agile Ceromonies Notes

- Daily Stand-ups: Usually they are quick (15-20 min) meetings where each team member shares what they did, what they’re working on, and any blockers they found along the way. The main purpose of these stnadups is that it keeps the team aligned daily.

- In Scrum, tasks are planned for the upcoming sprint (usually 1–2 weeks). On the otherhand, in Kanban, tasks are continuously pulled from the backlog based on priority and team capacity, no fixed sprint cycle.

- At the end of those sprints or during sprints, we have retrospectives. These are sort of like reflection sessions at the end of a sprint (Scrum) or periodically (Kanban) to discuss what went well, what didn’t, and how to improve.

- Backlog Refinement. It is an ongoing process of reviewing, clarifying, and prioritising tasks in the backlog so work items are clear and ready for development. Its basically maintaining the product backlog and ensures it is up to date.

### How Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment

They ensure everyone is on the same page. Stand-ups reduce team confusion about progress. Having sprint retrospectives build trust and an opportunity for the team to focus on what to imporve on and what not to do in the next sprint. Additionally, product backlog refinement prevents vague or poorly defined work and keeps the features clear and concise for developers.

### The most important ceromony for my role

I would say the daily stand-ups are most important because they let me share updates quickly and bring up any potential blockers I might have. This lets the team know of any HIDDEN DEPENDENCIES across different agile teams and how we canwork together to ensure it doesnt cause an future issues. Knowing how to handle these dependenices is definitely a key step in ensuring tasks are delivered on time.

Additionally, I also use daily standups as a way to check up on the progress of my teammates and hwo they are doing and if they need any assistance with blockers. I love the idea of standups as it allows the team to align their issues/ideas together in a short meeting.
